Taipan!
=======

A game based on the China trade of the 1800s.

Yeah, it's been done before, but I couldn't find another source which
had laid the game objects out in an object oriented style.

Intent here is to implement the kernel of the game in a way that
views could be implemented for an app, for virtual reality, or whatever. 

The current code is still very procedural and not very event-driven.
I think that's the main thing you'd want to change to make it really
usable in modern game engines.

There are many potential improvements to be made still.

Pull requests welcome!
